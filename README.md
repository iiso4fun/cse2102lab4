To set up this project, first install Flask with the command pip install Flask. Flask is a framework that allows the server to handle web requests. After installation, navigate to the directory containing the server script (my-server.py) and run it using the command python my-server.py. This command starts the server, which waits for login requests from the client. Make sure to keep the server running before you start the client script to ensure they can communicate.
